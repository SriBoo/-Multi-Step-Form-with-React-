# Multi-Step Form Project

This React application implements a responsive multi-step form with client-side data validation, local storage data persistence, and enhanced user experience through animations. The form consists of three main steps collecting personal information, address details, and a confirmation step where users can review their input before final submission.

## Features

- **Responsive Multi-Step Form**: The form adjusts to various screen sizes and provides a smooth navigation experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures all required fields are filled and formats such as email are correct before allowing the user to proceed to the next step.
- **Local Storage**: Utilizes local storage to persist user input across sessions, ensuring data is not lost when the browser is refreshed.
- **User Experience Enhancements**: Includes animations between form transitions and simulates network requests for a realistic submission process.
